# python-coding-test

Some simple python problems done by me!

Included in this are 3 problems solved by me. Each directory represents a file,
and each directory contains the problem in a stand alone markdown file
describing the problem I've solved.

Each README.md in each directory explains how to use/run the code that solves
the given problem, however in general they share some similarities.

## Python 3

All python code was coded under Python 3.5.2. Although it will probably work
with any Python 3.x release, as I tried to stay away from uber fancy python
features (which really pained me as I love [typings][1] so much)

## Pip 3

If a problem requires pip packages, there is a requirements.txt file with the
required packaged in it. The problem's README.md should mention this requirement
if need be.

## Style

I adhere to the [PEP8][2] rules when coding Python, so that style will be
represented in my code.

## Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or make an issue here!
